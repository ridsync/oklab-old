# Overview

* RxJava
* Retrofit

### General flow of data
* Check if there is cached data present in the internal file, if yes then load the cached data.
* Retrieve the latitude and longitude of the user.
* Request data from Weather Api
* If data received, cache it in internal file and show the updated data to user.
* If error then notify user about it.

### Build the Project
To build the project on your own follow these steps:
* Clone the project
* Get an API key from [Weather Api](https://market.mashape.com/fyhao/weather-13)
* Create a Kotlin file named `Secrets.kt`
* In that file create an `object` and add a variable `API_KEY` that contains the key that you got from the Weather Api.
```kotlin
object Secrets {
    val API_KEY = "your_api_key"
}
```
